# Weather Dashboard

## The weather dashboard is a handy tool for looking up weather forecasts in various places around the globe.

## The user inputs the name of a city and if it recognized by the Open Weather Map API, a current weather report is returned as well as a 5-day forecast for that city.  If the user inputs a zip code or postal code into the search area, an alert will pop up stating "location not found."

## Past searches are stored in local storage as well as in the form of a list on the web page.  If the user wants to view the current weather and the 5-day forecast for a city they have previously searched on, they do not need to type in the name of the city again.  The user can click on the name of the city in the search history list.
